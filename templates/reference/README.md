# Reference Materials

This folder contains quick-reference documents that complement the project templates. Start with `CHEATSHEET.md` for command-line reminders, git workflows, and automation recipes. The `gitignore.template` file provides a baseline ignore list you can tailor per project. Extend this directory with:

- `STYLEGUIDE.md` for language-specific conventions
- `RUNBOOKS.md` for operational checklists
- Link collections pointing to architecture diagrams or ADRs
